# Mystery-Box-Challenge_For-Freshies
This is the official repository of the Mystery Box Challenge organised by the Tinkerers' Laboratory. All the material and resources can be used for your reference.

We recommend you all, to start with Arduino Micro-controller, as it is easy to learn, and code. But, if you want to explore more, you are more than welcome to use other microcontrollers.

If you don't have Arduino, we recommend you, to practice coding, and setting up your account on TinkerCAD using this tutorial <br>

### Steps to be followed-
1. Go through the 2 PPT's.
2. We have added Arduino code (.ino files), which you can directly run in TinerCAD, and can play with it
3. We have also, added some photos of how the sensors, looks like.
4. After practising, you all have unlocked the skills, to participate in the [Mystery Box Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1nE6t7oxXSyu1lr7PiWFSRvwqNmygm4GKN123kOme8/edit).
